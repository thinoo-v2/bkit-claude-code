# Analysis Patterns Skill

## Analysis Types

### 1. Gap Analysis (Design-Implementation Differences)

Analysis that identifies differences between design documents and actual implementation

```markdown
# Gap Analysis Report

## Analysis Target
- Design document: docs/02-design/login.design.md
- Implementation path: src/features/auth/

## Results by Analysis Item

### API Endpoints
| Design | Implementation | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| POST /auth/login | POST /auth/login | ✅ Match |
| POST /auth/register | - | ❌ Not implemented |
| - | POST /auth/social | ⚠️ Missing from design |

### Data Model
| Field | Design | Implementation | Status |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------|
| email | string | string | ✅ |
| password | string | string | ✅ |
| createdAt | - | Date | ⚠️ Missing from design |

## Match Rate: 75%

## Recommended Actions
1. Implement POST /auth/register
2. Add social login to design document
3. Reflect createdAt field in design
```

### 2. Code Quality Analysis

Analysis of code quality, security, and performance issues

```markdown
# Code Quality Analysis Report

## Analysis Scope
- Path: src/
- File count: 45
- Total lines: 3,500

## Quality Metrics

### Complexity
| File | Function | Complexity | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| UserService.ts | processUser | 15 | ⚠️ High |
| utils.ts | formatDate | 3 | ✅ Acceptable |

### Code Smells
| Type | File | Line | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| Long function | api.ts | 45-120 | 75 lines (recommended: ≤50) |
| Duplicate code | helpers.ts | 10, 45 | Same logic repeated |

### Security Issues
| Severity | File | Issue |
|----------|------|-------|
| 🔴 High | auth.ts | Hardcoded secret |
| 🟡 Medium | api.ts | Missing input validation |

## Score: 72/100

## Improvement Recommendations
1. [High] Move auth.ts secret to environment variable
2. Split processUser function (SRP violation)
3. Extract duplicate code to utility
```

### 3. Performance Analysis

Analysis of performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

```markdown
# Performance Analysis Report

## Analysis Target
- Feature: Product list query
- Endpoint: GET /api/products

## Measurement Results

### Response Time
| Case | Response Time | Target | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|--------|
| 10 items | 50ms | 100ms | ✅ |
| 100 items | 450ms | 200ms | ❌ |
| 1000 items | 4.5s | 500ms | ❌ |

### Bottleneck Analysis
1. N+1 query problem
   - Location: ProductRepository.findAll()
   - Impact: 1 additional query per product

2. Missing index
   - Table: products
   - Column: category_id

## Optimization Recommendations
1. Solve N+1 with Eager Loading
2. Add index on category_id
3. Apply pagination as required
```

## Analysis Checklists

### Design Verification Checklist

```
□ Required sections exist
  □ Overview
  □ Architecture
  □ Data model
  □ API specification
  □ Error handling

□ Consistency
  □ Unified terminology
  □ Naming convention compliance
  □ Data type consistency

□ Completeness
  □ All endpoints defined
  □ All entities defined
  □ Error cases defined
```

### Code Analysis Checklist

```
□ Structure
  □ Architecture pattern compliance
  □ Correct dependency direction
  □ Appropriate module separation

□ Quality
  □ Appropriate function length (< 50 lines)
  □ No duplicate code
  □ Naming convention compliance

□ Security
  □ Input validation
  □ No hardcoded secrets
  □ SQL injection prevention
  □ XSS prevention

□ Performance
  □ No N+1 queries
  □ Appropriate indexes
  □ No unnecessary re-renders
```

## Report Writing Patterns

### Issue Classification Criteria

```
🔴 Critical (Fix immediately)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Potential data loss
- Potential service disruption

🟡 Warning (Improvement recommended)
- Performance degradation
- Maintenance difficulty
- Code smells

🟢 Info (Reference)
- Style improvements
- Insufficient documentation
- Insufficient tests
```

### Recommended Action Format

```markdown
## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Within 24 hours)
1. **[Critical] Fix security vulnerability**
   - File: src/auth.ts:42
   - Content: Move API key to environment variable
   - Owner: @developer

### Short-term (Within 1 week)
1. **[Warning] Performance optimization**
   - File: src/api/products.ts
   - Content: Solve N+1 query
   - Expected effect: 80% response time reduction

### Long-term (Backlog)
1. **[Info] Refactoring**
   - File: src/utils/
   - Content: Organize utility functions
```

## Analysis Tool Usage

### Claude Code Tools

```
Read      → Read file contents
Glob      → Search file patterns
Grep      → Search patterns in code
LSP       → Track definitions/references
Task      → Execute parallel analysis
```

### Analysis Query Examples

```
# Find design documents
Glob: docs/**/*.design.md

# Find specific patterns
Grep: "TODO|FIXME|HACK"

# Find hardcoded secrets
Grep: "api[_-]?key|secret|password"

# Find long functions
Grep: "function.*\{" -A 100
```
