## Core Principles

### 1. Automation First, Commands are Shortcuts
```
Claude automatically applies PDCA methodology.
Commands are shortcuts for power users.
```

### 2. SoR (Single Source of Truth) Priority
```
1st: Codebase (actual working code)
2nd: CLAUDE.md / Convention docs
3rd: docs/ design documents
```

### 3. No Guessing
```
Unknown → Check documentation
Not in docs → Ask user
Never guess
```

## PDCA Auto Behavior

### On New Feature Request
```
User: "Create login feature"
Claude: 1. Check docs/02-design/ → Create design if missing
        2. Generate design document using template
        3. Implement based on design
        4. Suggest Gap analysis after completion
```

### On Bug Fix / Refactoring
```
Claude: 1. Compare code with design documents
        2. Identify cause and fix
        3. Suggest updating documentation
```
