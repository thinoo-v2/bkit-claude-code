## 1. Why Role Redistribution

### Redistribution, Not Replacement

The essence of the AI Native era is not **"AI replaces humans."** It is **"The roles of humans and AI are redistributed."**

In past IT organizations, humans did everything. They planned, designed, wrote code, tested, and deployed. AI was merely an auxiliary tool for autocomplete or linting.

But things are different now. AI writes code, analyzes documents, performs tests, and generates reports. So what should humans do?

**The answer is clear. Humans must do what AI cannot.**

- **"Why" should we build this** — Setting purpose and direction
- **"Is this sufficient"** — Judging quality and value
- **"What should we do next"** — Making context-based decisions
- **"Does this align with our philosophy"** — Guarding identity and vision

This is role redistribution. Across every role, humans shift from **executors** to **judges**, from **workers** to **designers**.

### Real Data Proves the Transformation

The following is actual data from 13 days of AI collaboration.

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Total Sessions | 126 (~10 per day avg.) | Operating AI as a constant collaboration partner |
| Total Compute Hours | 260 hours | One human directing 260 hours of AI team output |
| Parallel Agent Orchestration | 477 instances | Operating AI as a project manager |
| Maximum Output | 9,770-line document (9-perspective analysis) | Producing weeks of human team output in a single session |
| Satisfaction Rate | 88.4% (199 positive / 26 negative) | Evidence that role redistribution actually works |

What these numbers demonstrate is simple. **The structure where humans set direction and AI executes is already working.**

## 2. CTO: From Conductor of Human Teams to Conductor of an Orchestra Including AI

### The CTO of the Past

The CTO of the past was **the person responsible for managing technical debt and resources, and delivering products to achieve business objectives.**

- Identified technical debt and established repayment strategies
- Optimally allocated technical resources such as personnel, budget, and schedules
- Determined technology strategies and architectures aligned with business goals
- Led the technical organization and held ultimate responsibility for the product's technical quality

The core competency was **"leading a human-only technical organization to achieve business objectives."**

### The CTO in the AI Native Era

The CTO in the AI Native era is **the conductor of an orchestra that includes both humans and AI.** The essence — managing technical debt, allocating resources, and delivering products — remains unchanged. What changes is that **AI is added to who is being conducted.**

Let's examine how this works in practice through data.

#### Real-World Case: 8-Person CTO Team Simulation

In one session, a CTO team composed of 8 AI agents was deployed to analyze a codebase. A **497-line executive report** was generated covering security, OS compatibility, MCP integration, and improvement recommendations. In another session, reverse engineering documentation from 9 perspectives totaling **9,770 lines** was produced and translated entirely into Korean.

Here is what the CTO did during this process.

| CTO's Role | Specific Actions |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Team Composition** | "Analyze from security, architecture, QA, frontend, and backend perspectives" |
| **Direction Setting** | "Analyze the impact of the v2.1.41 update on our plugin" |
| **Context Provision** | "Follow the same format as the previous v2.1.39 analysis report" |
| **Quality Judgment** | Reviewed deliverables and decided whether to commit |
| **Course Correction** | Immediately intervened when AI analyzed in the wrong scope (occurred 31 times) |

The CTO was never the person who directly wrote code, even in the past. What has changed is that, whereas previously the CTO delegated execution to **human team members**, now the CTO also delegates to and manages **AI agents** in the same way. AI has simply been added to the resource pool — the essence of technical leadership remains the same.

#### Core Competencies of the AI Native CTO

```
Past: "Leading a human organization to manage technical debt and deliver products"
Present: "Leading a human + AI organization to manage technical debt and deliver products"
```

The essence is identical, but with AI as a new resource, the following competencies expand:

1. **AI Resource Orchestration**: In addition to existing human resource management, the ability to compose and operate AI agent teams in parallel
2. **Context Design Capability**: The ability to provide business purpose and technical context so that AI operates in the right direction
3. **Quality Gate Operation**: The ability to judge whether deliverables from both humans and AI have "reached product-level quality"
4. **Course Correction Capability**: The ability to immediately detect and correct when AI is heading in the wrong direction (the same role as correcting human teams)
5. **AI Limitation Management**: The ability to understand the physical/logical limitations of AI (context, cost, accuracy) and reflect them in resource allocation

#### Maturity Model

```
Level 1: Using AI as a tool (autocomplete, code generation)
Level 2: Delegating tasks to AI (single task delegation)
Level 3: Operating AI teams (parallel agent orchestration)  ← Currently practicing
Level 4: Designing AI systems (autonomous PDCA pipelines)   ← Next goal
Level 5: AI managing AI (fully autonomous operations)
```

We are currently preparing for the transition from Level 3 to Level 4. This is a structure where the PDCA cycle executes fully autonomously — each stage of Plan → Do → Check → Act is performed by AI, and humans only intervene at gate failures or decision-making moments.

## 3. Product Owner: The Person Who Visualizes Philosophy

### The PO of the Past

- Organized requirements in text form
- Managed the backlog and set priorities
- Reviewed implementation results in sprint reviews

### The PO in the AI Native Era

AI can read text specifications and generate code. However, AI cannot independently determine **"why this product exists."**

**The PO in the AI Native era must establish the direction and identity of the product, and convey the pursued philosophy through visual materials and mockups.**

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Requirement Delivery | Text spec documents | Mockups + vision boards + philosophy declarations |
| Backlog Management | Writing Jira tickets | AI generates tickets, PO validates direction |
| Prioritization | Sprint planning | Providing AI with the context of "why this comes first" |
| Result Verification | Sprint review | Judging whether AI output "aligns with the philosophy" |

#### The PO's Core Transition

```
Past: "Build this" (What)
Present: "Why are we building this, who are we" (Why + Identity)
```

AI can implement "What" at astonishing speed. But deciding "Why" is something only humans can do. When the PO conveys philosophy through mockups and visual materials, AI can autonomously produce implementations that align with that philosophy. The core competency of the AI Native PO is providing **sensory direction** through visuals — something that text alone cannot convey.

## 4. Project Manager: The Person Who Runs Projects Alongside AI

### The PM of the Past

- Ran agile/sprints for teams composed solely of humans
- Managed schedules, resources, and risks
- Facilitated communication among team members

### The PM in the AI Native Era

**Rather than running agile/sprints for a team of only humans, the PM must plan projects and manage issues together with AI.**

Traditional PM methodologies were designed with the premise of "human limitations." Sprints are 2 weeks because humans struggle to predict work beyond 2 weeks. But AI is different.

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Sprint Duration | 2 weeks (human cognitive limits) | Hours to days (based on AI execution speed) |
| Resource Planning | N developers × M days | N AI agents × parallel execution |
| Schedule Management | Gantt charts, burndown | Real-time PDCA status monitoring |
| Issue Management | Manual Jira updates | AI auto-generates, PM enriches context |
| Communication | Standup meetings | Context synchronization between AI and humans |

#### The PM's Core Transition

```
Past: "Schedule management matched to human team speed and capabilities"
Present: "Project design that optimally arranges AI execution power and human judgment"
```

The AI Native PM designs not "who does what by when," but **"in what context and in what order should we have AI execute."** As demonstrated by 477 instances of task orchestration, the essence of project management shifts from "human coordination" to "AI-human collaboration design."

## 5. Planner: The Person Who Translates Purpose into Features

### The Planner of the Past

- Gathered requirements and wrote feature specifications
- Drew wireframes and flowcharts
- Delivered "build it like this" instructions to developers

### The Planner in the AI Native Era

**The planner must collect requirements from the Product Owner, explore the optimal methods to achieve the purpose, and organize them as features.**

In an era where AI can auto-generate code, the planner's role is not "writing feature specs." It is **exploring "what is the optimal method to achieve this purpose."**

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Requirement Gathering | PO meeting → text summary | Translating PO's philosophy and visual materials into context AI can understand |
| Feature Definition | Writing detailed specs | Purpose-centered feature definition + AI derives implementation methods |
| Method Exploration | Benchmarking, market research | Multi-angle analysis with AI (simultaneous research via parallel agents) |
| Deliverables | PRD documents | PDCA Plan documents (structured for AI execution) |

#### The Planner's Core Transition

```
Past: "The person who defines features in detail" (Deciding How)
Present: "The person who explores the optimal path to purpose achievement" (Connecting What and Why)
```

The AI Native planner delegates the implementation method (How) to AI and designs **the connection between "why is this feature necessary (Why)" and "what must be achieved (What)."** When the PO says "our users are like this," the planner translates it into "then this feature achieves this purpose." And AI executes "then I will implement it like this."

---

## 6. Designer: The Person Who Designs Brand into Experience

### The Designer of the Past

- Created screens in Figma/Sketch
- Built design systems
- Delivered assets and specs to developers

### The Designer in the AI Native Era

**Designers must embed branding and identity into the UI, and explore through mockups what UX should deliver each feature.**

AI can automatically generate UI. It can compose components, construct layouts, and even handle responsiveness. But AI cannot independently create **"the feel that is true to this brand."**

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| UI Creation | Pixel-level design | Establishing branding guidelines → AI generates UI |
| UX Design | Creating wireframes | Exploring UX philosophy through mockups, providing direction to AI |
| Design System | Component libraries | Defining design tokens and principles for AI to follow |
| Deliverable Handoff | Assets + redlines | Design systems that AI can directly read |

#### The Designer's Core Transition

```
Past: "The person who draws screens" (Production)
Present: "The person who explores experiences and guards identity" (Exploration + Identity)
```

The value of the AI Native designer lies not in **"making"** but in **"exploring."** What UX conveys this product's identity to users? What interaction most effectively achieves the purpose of this feature? Answering these questions through mockups and having AI implement those answers is the new role.

---

## 7. Frontend Developer: The Measurer of User Experience

### The Frontend Developer of the Past

- Implemented design mockups in HTML/CSS/JS
- Connected APIs and managed state
- Ensured browser compatibility

### The Frontend Developer in the AI Native Era

**Frontend developers must expand their scope to include the product perspective, implement UX to be measurable, and collect performance and interaction effect data to build features that achieve the product's philosophy and purpose.**

In an era where AI can auto-generate components and implement over 52 files in parallel, the role of the frontend developer fundamentally changes.

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Implementation Scope | Design → code conversion | Product philosophy → UX implementation → effect measurement |
| Performance Management | Lighthouse score optimization | User experience performance (perceived speed, interaction responsiveness) |
| Data Collection | Basic Analytics | UX measurement data (interaction effects, user behavior patterns) |
| Code Writing | Direct coding | AI codes, humans verify and correct from a UX perspective |
| Deliverable | "Working UI" | "An experience that achieves the philosophy" |

#### The Frontend Developer's Core Transition

```
Past: "The person who converts design to code" (Implementation)
Present: "The person who measures user experience and achieves product purpose" (Measurement + Purpose)
```

In an era where AI writes code, the core value of the frontend developer lies not in **"implementation"** but in **"measurement."** What effect does this interaction actually have on users? Does this performance degrade the user experience? Is this feature achieving the product's philosophy? Answering these questions with data and correcting AI's implementation from a product perspective is the new role.

## 8. Backend Developer: A Full-Stack Engineer Who Designs Architecture

### The Backend Developer of the Past

- Designed APIs and implemented business logic
- Wrote database queries
- Optimized server-side performance

### The Backend Developer in the AI Native Era

**Backend developers must expand into DBA and infrastructure domains, becoming architects who enable rapid deployment cycles, scalability, availability, and fast design changes.**

In an era where AI auto-generates APIs and implements CRUD in seconds, the backend developer's role expands from "writing code" to "designing systems."

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Scope of Responsibility | API + business logic | API + DB + infrastructure + architecture |
| Design Changes | High cost, cautious decisions | Rapid prototyping with AI → rapid design changes |
| Deployment Cycle | 2-week sprints | Daily or faster deployment cycles |
| Scalability | Pre-designed (over-engineering) | AI-based monitoring → scale when needed |
| DBA Role | Separate specialist | Backend developer handles data modeling + AI optimizes queries |

#### The Backend Developer's Core Transition

```
Past: "The person who implements APIs and business logic" (Implementation)
Present: "The person who designs scalable architecture and enables rapid change" (Architecture + Agility)
```

To keep pace with the speed at which AI writes code, the architecture itself must be **a structure that allows rapid change.** Microservices, event-driven architecture, BaaS utilization — the backend developer is no longer "the person who writes good code" but **"the person who designs systems that AI can rapidly implement and deploy."**

---

## 9. QA Engineer: A Quality Designer Who Ensures User Experience

### The QA Engineer of the Past

- Wrote and executed test cases
- Reported and reproduced bugs
- Performed regression testing before releases

### The QA Engineer in the AI Native Era

**While pursuing the product's purpose, QA engineers must ensure quality beyond unit tests, E2E tests, and integration tests, extending to testing user experience.**

In an era where AI automatically writes unit tests and can execute 646 test cases, the QA role expands from "writing tests" to "designing quality."

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Test Writing | Manual test cases | AI writes tests, QA designs scenarios |
| Test Coverage | Unit → Integration → E2E | + User experience testing (UX Quality) |
| Quality Standard | "No bugs" | "Product purpose achieved" |
| Verification Method | Functional verification | Functional verification + product philosophy alignment verification |
| Reporting | Bug reports | Quality reports + UX insights |

#### The QA Engineer's Core Transition

```
Past: "The person who finds bugs" (Bug Detection)
Present: "The person who ensures product purpose is achieved" (Purpose Assurance)
```

In an era where AI writes and executes tests, the core value of the QA engineer lies in **designing "what to test."** Not whether the code works, but whether **users achieve the product's purpose through this feature.** The quality gate of "Match Rate 90% or above" in the PDCA cycle's Check phase reflects this philosophy — it measures not just functionality, but the alignment rate with design intent.

---

## 10. Infrastructure DevOps: The Person Who Creates AI-Readable Infrastructure

### The DevOps Engineer of the Past

- Provisioned servers and built deployment pipelines
- Configured monitoring tools and responded to incidents
- Managed CI/CD

### The DevOps Engineer in the AI Native Era

**DevOps must manage infrastructure as modularized codebases in structures that AI can easily understand, expanding scope to include cost monitoring, availability, stability, and security.**

In an era where AI can write Terraform code and generate Kubernetes manifests, the DevOps role shifts from "building infrastructure" to "designing infrastructure that AI can operate."

| Area | Past | AI Native |
|------|------|-----------|
| Infrastructure Management | Console + scripts | IaC (Infrastructure as Code) — readable and modifiable by AI |
| Modularization | For convenience | Essential — AI understands and modifies at the module level |
| Monitoring | Performance + availability | + Cost monitoring + AI execution cost tracking |
| Security | Reactive response | Proactive security design + AI-based vulnerability scanning |
| Deployment | 1-2 times per week | Continuous deployment matched to AI's rapid deployment cycles |

#### The DevOps Engineer's Core Transition

```
Past: "The person who builds and operates infrastructure" (Build + Operate)
Present: "The person who designs AI-operable infrastructure and manages cost and security" (Design + Govern)
```

The key is **"AI-readable infrastructure."** When infrastructure is managed as code, modularized, and each component's role is clear, AI can autonomously perform changes, scaling, and incident response. The DevOps engineer designs that structure and takes responsibility for the governance domains of cost and security while AI operates autonomously.

## 11. The New Structure of AI Native Organizations

### The Past IT Organization Structure

```
CTO
├── PM (Schedule/Resource Management)
├── PO (Requirement Definition)
├── Planning Team (Feature Specification)
├── Design Team (UI/UX Production)
├── Frontend Team (UI Implementation)
├── Backend Team (API Implementation)
├── QA Team (Test Execution)
└── DevOps Team (Deployment/Operations)

Characteristics: Each role "executes" within their domain
Bottleneck: Handoffs between roles (Planning→Design→Development→QA)
```

### The AI Native Era Organization Structure

```
CTO (AI Orchestration)
│
├── Direction-Setting Layer (Why + What)
│   ├── PO: Visualizes philosophy and vision
│   ├── Planner: Translates purpose into features
│   └── Designer: Designs identity into experience
│
├── Execution Layer (How) — AI + Human Collaboration
│   ├── Frontend: UX measurement + AI implementation correction
│   ├── Backend: Architecture design + AI implementation verification
│   └── DevOps: AI-operable infrastructure design + governance
│
├── Quality Layer (Check + Act)
│   └── QA: Ensures product purpose achievement + UX quality
│
└── AI Agent Team (Execution Engine)
    ├── Code Generation Agents
    ├── Test Execution Agents
    ├── Analysis/Research Agents
    ├── Documentation Generation Agents
    └── Deployment/Monitoring Agents

Characteristics: Humans "judge", AI "executes"
Acceleration: Parallel execution instead of handoffs (PDCA-based)
```

### The Core Change: From Handoffs to Parallel Execution

The past organization had a **serial handoff** structure.

```
Planning → Design → Frontend → Backend → QA → Deployment
(Each stage completes before passing to the next)
```

The AI Native organization has a **parallel execution + synchronization** structure.

```
PO sets the philosophy
    ↓
Planner + Designer explore simultaneously
    ↓
AI Agent Team executes in parallel (Frontend + Backend + Infrastructure)
    ↓
QA verifies whether the product purpose is achieved
    ↓
Humans make the final judgment (commit/deploy decision)
```

Real data shows this structure is already working. The case of generating over 52 files in parallel across schema, API, UI, and migration layers proves this.

## 12. Conclusion: Redistribution Is Not Optional — It Is Essential

### The Common Transition Across All Roles

| Role | Past Core Competency | AI Native Core Competency |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **CTO** | Managing technical debt + product delivery with human organization | Managing technical debt + product delivery with human + AI organization |
| **PO** | Defining requirements | Philosophy visualization + vision delivery |
| **PM** | Managing human teams | AI-human collaboration project design |
| **Planner** | Writing feature specifications | Exploring purpose-to-feature connections |
| **Designer** | UI production | Identity guardianship + UX exploration |
| **Frontend** | Code implementation | UX measurement + product purpose achievement |
| **Backend** | API implementation | Architecture design + rapid change design |
| **QA** | Bug detection | Ensuring product purpose achievement |
| **DevOps** | Infrastructure construction | AI-operable infrastructure + governance |

### One Principle

One principle runs through every transition.

> **"Execution to AI, judgment to humans."**

AI can execute 260 hours in just 13 days. But "what to spend those 260 hours on" is something only humans can decide.

Role redistribution is not optional. At the point where AI surpasses humans in execution capability, **humans lose their value if they do not move into the domain of judgment.** Conversely, organizations that successfully move into the domain of judgment can leverage AI's execution power to create products at speeds and scales that were previously impossible.

That is the direction IT organizations must pursue in the AI Native era.
